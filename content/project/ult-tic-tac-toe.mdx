The multiplayer is unfinished and buggy, but you can play a game - make sure your password is over 8 characters, and once you play a game you have to leave, load the multiplayer, sign in, and then rejoin matchmaking.
but other than that it works mostly.

Don't open the settings or you will be stuck there.

Once you have made a username and password and pressed connect, you should be good to "Join Matchmaking" and try and play against someone else.
