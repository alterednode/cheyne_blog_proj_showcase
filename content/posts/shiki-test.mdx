## Shiki Test Post

This is a test post to show off what Shiki can do and to test formatting.

## Line Numbers
```ts showLineNumbers
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
console.log(a + b);
```

## Highlighted Line Ranges
```ts {2-3}
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
console.log(a + b);
```

## Focused Line(s)
```ts {1,3}
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
console.log(a + b);
```

## Word Highlight
```ts
// [!code word:console]
console.log("highlight the token console");
```
This was broken via switching to next's builtin MDX package, and wanting to keep turbopack.
I had to get rid of the transformers when converting to only using the **next.config.mjs**
