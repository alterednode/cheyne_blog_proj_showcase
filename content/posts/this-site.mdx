This site is a place for me to showcase project's I've worked on, write about things that interest me, and mess around with new web technologies.

I don't partiularially plan on working on frontend development professionally, but I am fairly critical of poor UI and UX, so having a personal site where I can experiment and practice is important to me.
Thats why I built this site from "scratch", to learn more about modern web development practices and tools.

## The basics

The site is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), which is a React framework for building server-rendered and statically generated web applications.
I'm using the react app router, so I can create dynamic routes for my posts, and fetch the MDX content at build time using Next.js's static generation features.

For styling, I'm using Tailwind CSS, which allows me to write utility-first CSS classes directly in my JSX.
It overwhelmed me at first delcaring so much css everywhere, but that is when I noticed I was underusing components.
Once I started creating reusable components for common UI patterns, it made the code much cleaner and easier to maintain.

I'm also using Next.js's new **@next/mdx** package to handle the MDX files as pages and content.

Markdown is porcessed via the [remark](https://remark.js.org/) and [rehype](https://rehypejs.github.io/) ecosystems, allowing me to use plugins to extend the functionality.

At the moment, I'm using [remark-frontmatter](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-frontmatter) to parse YAML frontmatter in my MDX files which I use for metadata like title, date, tags, and so on.
It lets me extract that data easily when rendering the pages, and use it to display the hero image, format the date, and list tags.

The other remark plugin I'm using is [remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) to support GitHub Flavored Markdown. It handles stuff like tables, task lists, and strikethroughs.

I'm also using [rehype-pretty-code](https://github.com/rehype-pretty/rehype-pretty-code) for syntax highlighting in code blocks, which gives me nice looking code snippets with line numbers and highlighting.

All of this is stored on github, and deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for easy updates and hosting.
Anytime there is a change on the main branch, Vercel automatically rebuilds and redeploys the site.

## MDX react components

This component takes a few props and renders a little “meter”.

I've also wrapped it in one of my standard **Card** components to give it a nice border, and then added some padding for spacing.
```tsx
// this is just a code block, more on them later
<Card className="p-6">
<MDXMeter label="Build progress" value={62} tone="secondary" />
</Card>
```
<Card className="p-6">
<MDXMeter label="Build progress" value={62} tone="secondary" />
</Card>
I created another component that tracks your scroll progress on the page, and passes that value to the meter component to make a reading progress bar.
```tsx
<ScrollTracker />
```
<ScrollTracker />


### Interactive props playground

This card is a client component: it has controls that update the props live.

<MDXMeterPlayground defaultLabel="Reading progress" defaultValue={38} defaultTone="accent" />
You can change the label, value, and tone of the meter using the controls above, and see the changes reflected in real-time.
