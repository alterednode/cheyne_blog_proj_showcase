This site is a place for me to showcase project's I've worked on, write about things that interest me, and mess around with new web technologies.

It's built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for content creation. This allows me to write blog posts and project pages using a combination of Markdown and React components, giving me the flexibility to do things like this:

## MDX react components

This component takes a few props and renders a little “meter”.

I've also wrapped it in one of my standard **Card** components to give it a nice border, and then added some padding for spacing.
```tsx
// this is just a code block, more on them later
<Card className="p-6">
<MDXMeter label="Build progress" value={62} tone="secondary" />
</Card>
```
<Card className="p-6">
<MDXMeter label="Build progress" value={62} tone="secondary" />
</Card>
I created another component that tracks your scroll progress on the page, and passes that value to the meter component to make a reading progress bar.
```tsx
<ScrollTracker />
```
<ScrollTracker />


## Interactive props playground

This card is a client component: it has controls that update the props live.

<MDXMeterPlayground defaultLabel="Reading progress" defaultValue={38} defaultTone="accent" />
You can change the label, value, and tone of the meter using the controls above, and see the changes reflected in real-time.
