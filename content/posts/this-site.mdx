## Stylistic Choices
I'm not and don't really plan on being a frontend developer, but as I am quite critical of UI / UX, I wanted to make sure my site was up to scratch.
The colours were chosen with realtimecolors.com, 


## Technical Details

The project uses modern web technologies:

```typescript
const config = {
  framework: "Next.js",
  styling: "Tailwind CSS",
  language: "TypeScript",
};
```

## Conclusion

This demonstrates how project showcases can be created alongside regular blog posts using the same unified system.
