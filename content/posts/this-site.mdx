This site is a place for me to showcase project's I've worked on, write about things that interest me, and mess around with new web technologies.

I don't partiularially plan on working on frontend development professionally, but I don't want to be completely out of touch with it either.
Thats why I built this site from "scratch", to learn more about modern web development practices and tools.
I also, as mentioned, wanted somewhere to at least showcase my projects.

## The basics

The site is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), which is a React framework for building server-rendered and statically generated web applications.
I'm using the react app router, so I can create dynamic routes for my posts, and fetch the MDX content at build time using Next.js's static generation features.

For styling, I'm using Tailwind CSS, which allows me to write utility-first CSS classes directly in my JSX.
It overwhelmed me at first delcaring so much css everywhere, but that is when I noticed I was underusing components.
Once I started creating reusable components for common UI patterns, it made the code much cleaner and easier to maintain.

I'm also using Next.js's new **@next/mdx** package to handle the MDX files as pages and content.

Markdown is porcessed via the [remark](https://remark.js.org/) and [rehype](https://rehypejs.github.io/) ecosystems, allowing me to use plugins to extend the functionality.

At the moment, I'm using [remark-frontmatter](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-frontmatter) to parse YAML frontmatter in my MDX files which I use for metadata like title, date, tags, and so on.
It lets me extract that data easily when rendering the pages, and use it to display the hero image, format the date, and list tags.

The other remark plugin I'm using is [remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) to support GitHub Flavored Markdown. It handles stuff like tables, task lists, and strikethroughs.

I'm also using [rehype-pretty-code](https://github.com/rehype-pretty/rehype-pretty-code) for syntax highlighting in code blocks, which gives me nice looking code snippets with line numbers and highlighting.

All of this is stored on github, and deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for easy updates and hosting.
Anytime there is a change on the main branch, Vercel automatically rebuilds and redeploys the site.

## MDX react components

This component takes a few props and renders a little “meter”.

I've also wrapped it in one of my standard **Card** components to give it a nice border, and then added some padding for spacing.
```tsx
// this is just a code block, more on them later
<Card className="p-6">
<MDXMeter label="Build progress" value={62} tone="secondary" />
</Card>
```
<Card className="p-6">
<MDXMeter label="Build progress" value={62} tone="secondary" />
</Card>
I created another component that tracks your scroll progress on the page, and passes that value to the meter component to make a reading progress bar.
```tsx
<ScrollTracker />
```
<ScrollTracker />


### Interactive props playground

This card is a client component: it has controls that update the props live.

<MDXMeterPlayground defaultLabel="Reading progress" defaultValue={38} defaultTone="accent" />
You can change the label, value, and tone of the meter using the controls above, and see the changes reflected in real-time.

## Tailwind CSS

I'm trying out Tailwind CSS for the first time on this project, and so far I'm finding it pretty interesting.
A lot of LLM - driven code tried to manually set colors all over the place, which made it hard to maintain a consistent design.
I fixed that by creating a set of custom colors in my Tailwind config, and then using those colors throughout the site.

I define a primary color, a secondary color, and an accent color, and then use those colors in my components and styles.
There's also derived colors for backgrounds, borders, and text, to make sure everything looks cohesive, as well as a matching set of dark mode colors.
 

## Code block highlighting

Here is a code block with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and a highlighted line.

```py  showLineNumbers {1-2, 4}
print("This is a code block with syntax highlighting.")
print("It is able to highlight specific lines")
print("Like lines 1 to 2 in this example.")
print("Or even just a single line.")
print("It can also show line numbers, as seen on the left.")
```

This is achieved using the **rehype-pretty-code** plugin, which allows for a lot of customization in how code blocks are rendered.

The highlighted lines are specified in the code block's meta string, using curly braces.
The line numbers are enabled with the `showLineNumbers` option.
````mdx showLineNumbers {2}
```py  showLineNumbers {1}
print("This is a code block with syntax highlighting.")
```
````

I can customize the colors and styles of the code blocks using CSS variables defined in my global stylesheet.

For example, the highlighted line background color is set to a mix of the accent color and transparency, to make it stand out without being too harsh on the eyes.
