# Welcome!

This is my first post using the new unified MDX post system.

## Features

The system supports:

- **Frontmatter validation** with Zod
- **MDX rendering** with @next/mdx
- Custom components like callouts

<Callout type="info">
  This is an informational callout!
</Callout>

## Code Examples

Inline code looks like `this`, and code blocks look like this:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```
